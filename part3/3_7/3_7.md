## `Dockerfile` size:
`1.02GB` -> `303MB`

I ended up using `python:slim` image instead of an Alpine-based, because building the image with it was a lot slower, and also introduced a lot of obscure runtime bugs that I didn't succeed to fix in the end. I also didn't manage to install some packages at all with it.
