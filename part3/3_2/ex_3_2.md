### Build script
 `script.sh` fetches a project from GitHub, uses its Dockerfile to build an image and pushes it to DockerHub. The script is run within a container that uses host's Docker engine for everything Docker-related. It takes a GitHub repository and a DockerHub image name as arguments and before pushing to DockerHub it also prompts for DockerHub username and password.

### Usage
`docker-compose run app <GitHub username>/<repo name> <DockerHub username>/<repo name>`
